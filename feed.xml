A week before this backpack, I went with another friend to Raven’s rock as a practice hike (about 6 miles in and out with fully loaded backpack) and to gauge the popularity. The hike seemed doable. On the practice hike, we met two people, a father and a son-in-law, backpacking the same exact route, just backwards. A conversation with them felt promising and they encouraged to use the campsite located around a cabin along the way. The water source was apparently 1/10th of a mile hike from the campsite.</p> <p>With this information, I remember feeling a sense of rejuvenation to be outdoors for a longer period of time. Next Saturday, the Labor Day weekend of 2022, my friend (Totorro) and I started out journey from Fairfax, Virginia. The plan was to park one car at Bear’s den and drive back in another car from Harper’s Ferry. We packed our bags, a 65 L Osprey and a 43 L Deuter, distributed weight as much as possible, and arrived at Bear’s Den around 10 AM.</p> <p>The plan was to try to do this route in 3 days, but also try to do it in 2 days - marking the beginning of mismanagement, ill-planning, and upcoming experience. We ended up doing this in two days, with a campsite at WayPoint 9 (39.22735,-77.7793) marked as Shelter/Camp in this map below. The water source was, as the two people indicated, about 1/10th of a mile from the campsite. But it was a trickling source and those 1/10th mile were steep ascend/descend.</p> <iframe class="alltrails" src="https://www.alltrails.com/widget/map/map-august-19-2022-a46b6b5--2?u=i&amp;sh=aw8vfq" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" title="AllTrails: Trail Guides and Maps for Hiking, Camping, and Running"></iframe> <h4> Three Lessons Learnt </h4> <p>Succinctly: Never leave the planned number of days to the trail and friends; Distribute weight more evenly; Listen to your body and take a dip in the river (I did not) even if the mind is tired.</p> <h3> 1. Mileage </h3> <p>The first five miles to Raven’s Rock were alright. A little up and down the hills (part of the <em>rollercoaster</em> section of the Maryland AT) but nothing to push us back. We had about 1.5 hr late start so we reached there around 12:30 pm. We rested there enjoying the view, stretching our backs, a light snack before heading out on the trail. This was when we decided (or I being persuaded) to complete the section in 2 days.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" style="text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Blog_pics/Harpers/Ravens.JPG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/Blog_pics/Harpers/Ravens.JPG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/Blog_pics/Harpers/Ravens.JPG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/Blog_pics/Harpers/Ravens.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="One break" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> A stop at Raven's Rock at 12:30 AM </div> <p>Hiking the next section of about 5 to 6 miles to an undecided campsite was when the challenge began. I could feel my thighs getting tired immediately after a little ascend. My mind raced in thousand directions trying and I was consciously trying to untangle every single trailing thought to the next but in vain.</p> <p>We kept going on the trail that went through thick forests sometimes surrounded by ferns, sometimes by rocks, and sometimes overgrowing forest. We started making frequent stops around mile 8, knowing we still had about 2 miles to the campsite. Perhaps determined to test our limits, we kept going without eating much. We were convincing ourselves to go just a mile more towards the campsite. At one moment, I was so engaged in walking that I walked past a long snake by the trail without noticing it. My friend (Totorro) noticed, stopped, called me and we both watched the snake cross the trail before continuing.</p> <p>Exhausted out of my mind and body, we reached the campsite around 6:30 pm, with about 30 to 45 minutes left until sunset. We set up our tents, went to collect water on a stream that was about 1/10th of a mile from the tents. The water source was merely a trickling stream, and it took us longer than expected to filter and fill up the bottles. I saw a tiny water snake move away while I was filling up the bottles. We ate when it was dark, stretched in our individual tents, and fell into the void of the night.</p> <p>Next day, we had about 10 more miles to go, mostly flat or downhill, something which I enjoyed but my friend (Totorro) did not. But we woke up tired, had breakfast and started our hike to Harpers Ferry around 10 AM. By the time we reached Harpers Ferry, I was dragging my feet with every step, exhausted, tired, and mad at doing the backpack in two days. I found the closest spot under the tree, threw my bag and closed my eyes without even considering any other option.</p> <p>I would do the same mileage again, but I was not prepared physically or mentally for that at that time. My friend (Totorro) later told me he was never so tired from a hike before. Lesson - Do not overestimate your ability to cover more miles, especially on the AT.</p> <h3> 2. Food and Backpack </h3> <p>Over-planning or under-planning on food is always a lesson learnt in hindsight. I decided to carry a bear canister with about 5 or more days worth of food for two people - the biggest mistake. We practically had all the food left after completing the trip. The trail is heavily used so maybe the use of bear canister was unnecessary. Regardless, I would still use it the next time, if there is one.</p> <p>The food that we ate, and that we enjoyed, was dry and I could have avoided carrying a stove, gas canister, mess kit if I had planned better. The food that saved us on the second day, when we decided to have a dedicated lunch break, was thick Indian (specifically Sindhi) <em>Koki</em> made primarily from wheat flour, jaggery, spices. That was a meal to remember and perfect example of traditional food adopted for backpacking. My friend (Totorro) also brought strawberry flavored 5-hr energy drink, which I had only a sip of on the first day as our <em>lunch</em>, was the worst meal to remember. This is how much points I would give our planning of food and backpack for this trip.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" style="text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Blog_pics/Harpers/3.JPG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/Blog_pics/Harpers/3.JPG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/Blog_pics/Harpers/3.JPG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/Blog_pics/Harpers/3.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="50%" height="auto" title="Zero" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Zero points for food and backpack planning </div> <p>A better way to plan food would have been first to decide the number of days and minimize unnecessary emergency food. Planning for one extra emergency meal is wise if the backpacking trip is close to the civilization (like this one). Secondly, distributing weight should have been this way: I carry all the tents, sleeping pads, clothes, back-up clothes etc. and let my friend (Totorro) carry only the bear canister (the heaviest of everything.) Having a good backpack is crucial and we were grateful to at least have that right in our food and backpack planning. A hard lesson which made me learn and realize better planning for next trips.</p> <h3> 3. Pilgrimage </h3> <p>This by no doubt, was, is, and will be my experience of every backpacking or hiking trip. Each day, action, planning had its way of creating a whirlpool of thoughts that later needed to be untangled. But the trees, forests call and hug me from above and below on such experiences. This calling is the primary reason for me to hike, backpack and be with the nature.</p> <p>There were patches on the trail which were filled with a thin layer of soft sand (seemingly beach sand). Walking on these after walking on the rocks and hard trail was a surreal experience to remember. Whenever we came across such patches, I felt as if the sand tickled me through my hiking boots and always found myself literally laughing while walking on these. Although we were exhausted at the end, my legs felt stronger than I could remember in recent past 5 years or more. Realizing the growth, all I can do is close my eyes and let the moment pass.</p> <p>The views from the Raven Rocks and Harpers Ferry were definitely a reward from a long, tiring hike. It was difficult to convince my mind to wash away the pain, the anger in the river at Harpers Ferry, and so I just dropped under a tree’s shade when we finally arrived at our destination. My friend (Totorro) went into the river and I can only dream of doing that then.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" style="text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Blog_pics/Harpers/2.JPG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/Blog_pics/Harpers/2.JPG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/Blog_pics/Harpers/2.JPG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/Blog_pics/Harpers/2.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="80%" height="auto" title="Raven's rock" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" style="text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Blog_pics/Harpers/4.JPG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/Blog_pics/Harpers/4.JPG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/Blog_pics/Harpers/4.JPG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/Blog_pics/Harpers/4.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="80%" height="auto" title="Harpers Ferry" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> View from Raven's Rock(left).

I had to handle a tiny sample holder containing 4 mg of a sample with a pair of tweezers and place it on top of a thin disk, which was a part of a $5000 delicate sample carrier sitting on top of a mass balance. It was the first time I attempted to perform experiments that directly impacted my research. Quite naturally, my at-the-time fidgety hands dropped the lid inside the mass balance and required careful extraction using a pair of tweezers with the steady hands of a research colleague.</p> <h4> Zero </h4> <p>In hindsight, this episode triggered a series of changes in the following years - some so tiny that I never thought it would create a big difference in the outcomes. At the moment when I dropped the lid, I vividly remember that just a flash of a moment ago, I had envisioned the future scene, including the emotions on my future face.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>The reality I was facing was separated only fractionally in time and space from the dream that my mind steered me through.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Quite often, guilt and shame have a way of quickly filling the emptiness created in the stillness of such an event. Surprisingly, none of those managed to exist in that space for me, and the incident did not bother my advisor as he calmly, yet in a slight worry, assigned the experienced researcher to the rescue of the equipment. What shifted in me, were two things - <strong>one, the curiosity to understand how that all happened within a dreaming moment</strong>, and <strong>two, the urge to become steadier and not recreate the incident.</strong></p> <p>During that time, I was adjusting to the process of physical therapy to recover from a knee injury, which I suffered while playing football (soccer) about a year ago. The injury had become chronic and reduced my left thigh to a circumference that was about 2.5 inches smaller than the healthy right thigh (Yes, I regularly measured the circumference of my thighs during my recovery). This, according to the diagnosis, reduced the disk spaces in my lower spine and thereby affected my mobility. The chronic knee (and back) injury forced me to abstain from undertaking any physically challenging tasks. My movement included only short walks assisted by a knee brace, frequent switches between sitting and standing to avoid prolonged strain and sleeping only on the back on a mattress of a particular thickness and comfort.</p> <p>The lid incident created a butterfly effect as the curiosity to understand and the urge to change rippled through almost every aspect of my existence. However, I could hardly imagine then how long it would take to literally get back on my two feet.</p> <h4> The Body </h4> <p>First, I had to start with taking care of my knee and lower back to reduce pain while doing regular activities. I cannot even begin to describe the disarray of healthcare in the U.S I faced as I went from painkiller to painkiller for about a year until I finally got some sense of direction in India in August of 2016. The diagnosis was that I suffered multiple tendon and ligament partial tears and degeneration of lumbar disc. Surgery was not recommended but I started off with physical therapy.</p> <p>I started two/three day a week physical therapy at the health center of Texas A&amp;M University and then transitioned to University of Maryland in 2017. The progress was slow. Being a PhD student puts you in a status which hangs in between a full-time faculty and a full-time student. But I was fortunate to get references from the health center at UMD to a physical therapist near UMD.</p> <p>This is where I believe I recovered the most, in a way I had never imagined before. I started thrice a week and transitioned to twice a week after some progress. This therapist was a Doctor of Physical Therapy and began initially with making me understand how my body is reacting physically to chronic pain.</p> <p>The first test was how much I can contract my left thigh - I could not even feel that I could contract my thigh. I had lost every bit of feeling there. He explained to me that my body has reached a state of survival and has stiffened in a weird way, referred as atrophy. So, he started first with electrical stimulation of muscles, especially around the lower back and cold treatment of the knee after minor stretching exercises.</p> <p>He had instructed to follow cold treatment of the knee and hot treatment for the back after every day physical therapy. On days when I didn’t have the physical therapy scheduled, I judiciously was found on a yoga mat at 6 pm doing the stretching exercises given by this therapist and my doctor in India. The prescribed exercises involved holding for 20 s in a particular stance that attempted to activate the muscles and gain strength. After about 10 type of exercises and 30 minutes, followed the 15 minute cold treatment of the knee with the legs bent at 90 degrees at the hip and the knee, and lying flat on the back on an electric heating pad. This was the moment when I stared at the ceiling lying on my bed and patiently observed.</p> <p>Naturally, I was critically low on vitamin-D and vitamin-B12 and upon recommendations from the doctors, I convinced myself to try natural sources. Vitamin-D was easy to manage by sticking to at least 15-30 minute exposure to the sun, but naturally replenishing vitamin B-12 required courage to cook salmon or the most dreaded liver soup. A dear friend and roommate of mine joined me, given his low vitamin situation too, in sharing the suffering caused while consuming the liver soup. The shared suffering made the soup nourish us for longer. I clearly remember estimating the number of days we would have to continue vitamin replenishment by considering the initial values the lab measured for both of us, the final recommended value, the absorption rate in an average human, and the average loss of B-12.</p> <blockquote> <p>Memories are often created when the experiences are shared, and not necessarily spoken. But in hindsight, switching to salmon earlier would have been better for the memories.</p> </blockquote> <p>The routine of exercising and resting after work and collecting vitamins from natural sources had replaced sports (football, swimming, racquetball, or jogging). What these exercises were doing was essentially imposing a discipline, something which I cherished being active in sports since childhood. In those times when I rested in and after relatively calmer exercises than active sports, I started to see something surfacing - the working of my mind.</p> <h4> The Mind </h4> <p>The extent of activity going on in the mind is, without a doubt, beyond comprehension. Some activity is visible immediately, such as a momentary thought that influences an action. But the mind gives out a convoluted, encrypted output easy enough to understand, but the difficult part if to identify the source of those outputs.</p> <p>I knew somewhere below the convoluted outputs that the uneasiness of the hands that shivered during the experiments had a ‘mindful’ source, or possibly a predictor/enabler of the dreams. Thinking again and again about the lid-dropping incident, it made me come face-to-face with the goofy creature in my mind that was an enabler of day dreams. It was a unruly child that perhaps missed laughing over someone’s fault, or missed trickery of the childhood. This unruly child was having fun while on the exterior, my conscience was confused with the turn of events.</p> <blockquote> <p>Being disciplined or not-disciplined both give birth to either a god or a devil - the former (god) goes by many names such as happiness or pleasure and the latter (devil) called pain or regret. But the difficult question was whether the mind can choose to create one or the other and to what extent.</p> </blockquote> <p>Imposing discipline via physical therapy exposed the unruly child’s thoughts and patterns that were beneath the immediate surface of my mind. Perhaps, I started to think that my expression, bodily pain was partially influenced by this part of the mind. If this was the case, it meant that I would need to make peace with this unruly child and alleviate physical uneasiness. Of course, the first experiment was trying to easy the hands to do experiments. <em>What this meant was to consciously pay attention to every moment my hands became uneasy, identify the source, confront the thoughts that initiated the uneasiness, acknowledge that I no longer need to hold those thoughts in my hands, let go and restart from where I left.</em></p> <p>This was a continuous process, a continuous feedback loop that was motivated my curiosity to understand working of my mind and the urge to be better at what I do. I did not have any words for this process back then, but later acknowledged this as the process of meditation. Of course there are various classification of meditation in different religions - some giving importance to an object (external or internal) of meditation and some giving more importance to the daily activities of life. Broadly, they all agree that the ultimate goal is to ‘be with the flow of consciousness’.</p> <p>As discipline was demanded by my research and physical therapy, the process of understanding the mind started to become a cherishing experience. During the daily cold treatment of the knee and heat treatment of the back, I started to notice that stiffness in my back and pain in my knee bubbled onto the surface. It seemed like the pain bubbled out of these places as I let the mind do its work during my time of patient observation.</p> <blockquote> <p>It seems that the mind is involved in a continuous optimization process to finding local or global minima of pain/please and maxima of pleasure/pain. Usually, they both co-exist.</p> </blockquote> <p>My mind was working towards the same goal that I had - to alleviate pain, to be free. Often riddled with the question, “to be or not to be?”. But it seemed that everything was condensing in a pattern that I could follow to gain strength.</p> <h4> The Mind and The Body </h4> <p>The challenges imposed by the Ph.D. studies, the physical therapy, slowly made it clear that the source of the thoughts, feelings, and emotions is sometimes held together by the physical body, not necessarily directly in the brain. For example, the fidgety hands held a great amount of uneasiness that the mind carried with it. The challenge started with first decoupling the uneasiness from the hands so that I could do the experiments I needed to do - a fun challenge for the mind. It took a while, but slowly, the mind was able to let go of the uneasiness from the hands.</p> <p>I realized what my mind and the body both like to do together,</p> <ul> <li>Challenge</li> <li>Learn from the experience</li> <li>Give kindness</li> <li>Soak in the nature outdoors</li> </ul> <p>This is what they needed to learn,</p> <ul> <li>Receive kindness</li> <li>Forgive the uneasiness</li> <li>Let-go of the uneasiness</li> <li>Rest from time to time</li> </ul> <p>The mind and the body started to work together to gain strength. <strong>A. Very. Long. Process.</strong> It started with muscle activation physical therapy, then some 20 s long exercises, then a slow 5 minute cycling/stair-master, then a 10 minute walk outdoors, then a 10 minute hike, then a swim, a walk with 5 pound ankle weight, 10 pound ankle weight, a longer hike, then carrying my bag to the campus without pain, carrying my bag during an international travel without pain, a hike with a heavier bag, and then finally a 2.5-day backpacking trip after 5 years.</p> <blockquote> <p>Painless is the last adjective for this journey. Pain was present while healing and also while accepting the new challenges.</p> </blockquote>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="personal"/><category term="philosophy"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The journey of recovery from a chronic injury]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Are We Humans or Are We Fractals?</title><link href="https://dushyant-fire.github.io/blog/2021/Are-we-humans-or-are-we-fractals/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Are We Humans or Are We Fractals?"/><published>2021-12-03T16:40:16+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-03T16:40:16+00:00</updated><id>https://dushyant-fire.github.io/blog/2021/Are%20we%20humans%20or%20are%20we%20fractals</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://dushyant-fire.github.io/blog/2021/Are-we-humans-or-are-we-fractals/"><![CDATA[<p>Art and Science are considered separate disciplines, but very few comprehend their delicate intimacy. Their relationship so delicately arranged that it often goes unnoticed. The inconspicuously conspicuous intricacy is hidden deep under the mirage of modern illusions. Many of these are visible but are unconsciously overlooked.</p> <p>Fractal geometries are self-similar patterns, which appear similar at different magnification levels. For a simpler explanation, it is the movie Inception, ‘Dream within a dream within a dream…’. The beauty of fractals is subject to the perception of the eye. But as a calm rippling stream of water and a violent eruption of a volcano, can be beautiful, depending on the prejudice you use to see them, fractals may be either mesmerizing or daunting. The ubiquitous fractal patterns are observed on a leaf, the branching of trees, the system of a river delta, the interplay of clouds, the shape of galaxies. From microscopic to macroscopic scales, the significance of fractals seems to be rooted deep in our existence.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Blog_pics/fractal_leaf-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/Blog_pics/fractal_leaf-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/Blog_pics/fractal_leaf-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/Blog_pics/fractal_leaf.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="fractal_leaf" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Fractal pattern of a leaf </div> <p>In the early 20th century, Lewis Fry Richardson showed how the length of the British coastline depends on the unit of measurement. Building upon this theory, Benoit Mandelbrot introduced the word fractal in the 1970s after which it became a catapult for mathematicians and scientists. A measure of time was historically defined by the Earth’s rotation cycle of a 24 hour day. A more accurate representation defines a second in terms of the decay cycle of a radioactive Caesium atom which is more accurate than the historical definition which does not consider the constantly changing duration of Earth’s rotation.</p> <p><strong>Even time, which we humans are so tethered to fails the objective definition</strong>. It’s definition being relative, it is worthwhile to laugh next time at the thought that makes us scramble to catch up on every second. similar to time, the boundaries called countries encapsulating a collection of people, competing over territorial, communal and racial concerns, would be different if the unit for the judgment was different. Just as Earth’s rotation defines time, it is imperative to understand what prejudice determines this judgment and distinction of people.</p> <p>Interestingly enough, the complexity of fractals is visible in its dimension. As a line has dimension 1, a square has a dimension of 2, a sphere is 3 dimensional, a fractal can have dimensions that are not integers. A fractal of dimension 1.585 is shown here as the Sierpinski triangle.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Blog_pics/Sierpinski-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/Blog_pics/Sierpinski-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/Blog_pics/Sierpinski-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/Blog_pics/Sierpinski.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="fractal_tree" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> A Fractal tree derived from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle">Sierpinski triangle</a> </div> <p>Dr. Richard Taylor has analyzed various types of fractal patterns such as the paintings of Jackson Polluck, and the entanglements of the trees. He found that the fractal dimension of Jackson Polluck’s life-sized paintings is similar to the fractal dimension of the natural patterns of trees. <strong>He found that observing fractal images of dimensions 1.3-1.5 has shown to reduce stress levels by 60 %.</strong> They have been found to activate the regions of the brain associated with high-level visual processing (ventrolateral cortex), spatial long-term memory (dorsolateral cortex) and emotion regulating (parahippocampus) which is active while listening to music. <strong>So the next time, stress tries to grip you and if you don’t believe in your self-awareness, believe in science and go for a walk in the nature to make yourself feel better.</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>The fact that the human brain is hard-wired to process such patterns raises a thought – Since resonance means alignment of two things, Do our minds resonate with these images because that is how our natural state is?</p> </blockquote> <p>The fractal nature of humans, as an individual, a society and a culture also showcase the self-similarity as it becomes magnified from microscopic to macroscopic levels. The individual perceptions of events and processes happening around us carve our personality. Ayn Rand in ‘The Fountainhead’ said that “Man’s nature is the product of its premises”.</p> <blockquote> <p>The perception of the premises is what conditions our nature and makes us as an individual.</p> </blockquote> <p>A tree does not become a tree unless someone teaches a child that the poem written by the earth on the sky has a title ‘tree’. But a grown-up child can consciously decide not to call it a tree, but a ‘pedh’. As these unconscious and conscious decisions sculpt the pattern of thoughts that make up our individual ‘identity’, a family identity reflects the interpersonal relational dynamics, a local disposition highlights regional demeanor and a national identity gives birth to stereotypes. Our psychological development starts from the microscale teaching and bursts into an interplay of what was learned and what is ‘unlearnt’ through the conscious judiciary. The convoluted nature of human psychology is fractal.</p> <p>A fractal dimension is not necessarily an integer, implying that the social and natural phenomena observed are not Euclidian, or linearly scalable, in nature. An extension of a stereotype to an individual dissolves the individual complexity through which the human character was developed. The complexity of the processes should be appreciated and addressed with the non-linearity of the natural world in mind. The simple linear extrapolations of the fractal nature of the world are ignored, lost and simplified.</p> <p>The units of measurements which are our prejudices severely affect our ability to accept any individual for the way they are. The better we understand where these prejudices come from, and explore the hidden fractal pattern that lies under each prejudice, we can be more self-aware of ourselves and others. We would be in resonance with the fractal universe that is both inside and outside us.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="personal"/><category term="philosophy"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Contemplating existence]]></summary></entry></feed>
