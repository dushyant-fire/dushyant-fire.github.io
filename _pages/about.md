Hi! Iâ€™m Dushyant Chaudhari and currently working as a Research Engineer at the <a href='https://fsri.org'>Fire Safety Research Institute (FSRI)</a>, a part of <a href="https://ul.org">UL Research Institutes</a>. I completed my Ph.D in Mechanical engineering at University of Maryland (UMD), College Park where I researched on the problem of material flammability, pyrolysis, flame spread via multi-scale experiments and modeling. Prior to that, I completed my Masters in Chemical Engineering at Texas A&M University, College Station. I am from India and completed by bachelors in Chemical Engineering at Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT, Nagpur).

This website is a collection of brief summary of my [academic research](/projects/), a continuously updated collection of open source coding observations pertaining to [open source coding](/blog/) and personal [hobbies](/blog/). 

Feel free to reach out to me at [dush.chaudhari@gmail.com](mailto:dush.chaudhari@gmail.com) or connect with me at any of the media handles in the bottom navigation bar. I am particularly interested in applying my skills for research in model development for wildland-urban interface (WUI) region, waste up-cycling via pyrolysis, and modeling of heat transfer and thermodynamic processes.
